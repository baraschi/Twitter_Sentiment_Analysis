# Text Sentiment Classification
Predict if a tweet message used to contain a positive :) or negative :( smiley, by considering only the remaining text.

__[Description](https://github.com/epfml/ML_course/tree/master/projects/project2/project_text_classification)__

__[Competition](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/epfl-ml-text-classification/)__

__Data__ Twitter data files found in data/twitter-datasets/

– Reproducibility: In your submission, you must provide a script run.py which produces exactly the same .csv predictions which you used in your best submission to the competition on CrowdAI. This includes a clear ReadMe file explaining how to reproduce your setup, including precise training, prediction and installation instructions if additional libraries are used - the same way as if you would ideally instruct a new teammate to start working with your code.
– Documentation: Your ML system must be clearly described in your PDF report and also well- documented in the code itself. A clear ReadMe file must be provided. The documentation must also include all data preparation, feature generation as well as cross-validation steps that you have used.
– External ML libraries are allowed, as long as accurately cited and documented.
– External datasets are allowed, as long as accurately cited and documented.
